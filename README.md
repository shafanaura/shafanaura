### 🙋‍♀️ Hi, <b>Shafa</b> here!

I’m a Freelance Fullstack Engineer working mostly with JavaScript/TypeScript, and yes — I’m open to part-time opportunities (hire me before someone else does 👀).

I help people build websites that actually solve problems, not just sit there looking pretty (although I can do pretty too ✨). From landing pages to web apps, I’m here to bring your ideas to life — with clean code and occasional keyboard smashing.

Sometimes I share random thoughts and stories from my journey as a software engineer on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@shafanaura) in Bahasa — mostly tech, sometimes dramatic monologues about debugging at 2 AM.

Outside of coding, I’m interest in following business, marketing, investing, and startups — basically anything about tech and makes the brain go brrr 🧠⚡.

Ping me if you’ve got a cool project, startup idea, or just wanna share war stories from the land of infinite `console.logs` 🐛🔥
